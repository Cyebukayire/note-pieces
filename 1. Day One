9 Feb, 
Publicly writing, that perhaps a day will come when nothing else interests me but to read these notes. 

The idea of opinions. Why would one feel obliged to have opinions on things like politicians, education, leadership, or even food and the weather today. Tell me your story but understand that I'm choosing to keep my opinions closed on topics I'm not excited about yet. 

Opinions and statements about one's ways of life, I love hearing about it as much as I enjoy mutual respect in contrasting customs and values. Isn't it the ideal human interaction? The imperfect
interruptions, the unavoidable unecessary laughters, and sorries!

I'm unbothered by the intrinsic nature of our essence to enforce ideas to the ground truth of us, and I'm unbothered to disclose a discussion with a NO!
