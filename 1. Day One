Not even sure why I should pull this move of writing, rarely write, but I enjoy reading, this is a challenge for me to push myself to write publicly, that perhaps a day will come when nothing
else interests me but to read my own notes. 

The idea of opinions. Why do we feel obliged to have opinions on things like politics, education, leadership, or even food and the weather today. First thing I need to think about is nothing,
or maybe a challenge, an open volleyball game, a new published method, or a real story. I'm choosing to keep my opinion closed on topics I'm not excited about. 

Opinions and statements about one's ways of life, I love hearing about it as much as I enjoy mutual respect in contrasting customs and values. Isn't it the ideal human interaction? The imperfect
interruptions, the unavoidable unecessary laughters, and sorries!

I'm unbothered by the intrinsic nature of our essence to enforce ideas to the ground truth of us, and I'm unbothered to disclose a discussion with a NO!
