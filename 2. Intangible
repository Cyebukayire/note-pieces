10 Feb,

Some emotions are familiar, that you read a piece and smile, then all of a sudden you've found someone funny, relatable, and capable to find words of your own lived experience. Isn't it
amazing that the things I go through, there are literally a thousand other people enjoying the fun side of it, or maybe just playing around! I was talking to a friend, it was such
a cold day, while we put on our heels to the modelling practice, she had a lot of homework to do, but had not yet done anything since morning, we were at 2 pm. 
I thought for a moment, "Me TOO!", some days are just coming to remind us to slow down a bit, stop thinking about what's next, and think about who this 
beautiful girl is next to me. What are they concerned about? At the end of the day, you get nothing significant done, but then remember you talked to a human 
being in-person, and smile to sleep.

Some experiences are just bizarre, especially interracial interactions in spaces that aren't ready for it yet. These are some other moments I know for sure a thousand other people
gracefully carry through, and I'm just one of them. Some sentiments are intangible right now, the more I read Chimamanda's text, the more the language of life gets a little bit Sweotol.
100% Can see it!
