10 Feb,

Some emotions are familiar, that you read a piece and smile, then all of a sudden you've found someone funny, relatable, and capable to find words of your own lived experience. Isn't it
amazing that the things I go through, there are literally a thousand other people enjoying the fun side of it, or maybe just playing around! I was talking to a friend, it was such
a cold day, while we put on our heels to the modelling practice, she had a lot of homework to do, but had not yet done anything since morning, we were at 2 pm. I thought for a moment, "Me TOO!", 
some days are just coming to remind us to slow down a bit, stop thinking about what's next, and think about who this beautiful girl is next to me? What are they 
concerned about? At the end of the day, you get nothing significant done, but then remember you talked to a human being in-person, and smile to sleep.
