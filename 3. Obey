12 Feb,

To the inner joy seeking a little bit of comfort, coming from a basketball game, surely tired yet proud that on a day filled with classes, workloads, meetings, I did something for myself. 
Well, for I, myself, and me. LOL. Still there is a void to fill, so many more meetups and Labs to prepare for, I check the schedule for tomorrow, then afraid I'll forget 
I just had a good day.

What's so comforting than getting uncomfortable? Isn't it cute though:) Knowing surely it's a coin flip, I get it all or lose it all. And I can say that's a beautiful part of life, 
Oh LORD, I mean it!
