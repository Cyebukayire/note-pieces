Hedonism, the new word I just learned, defines the intrinsic motivation in human behaviour in search of a more exciting, less painful or boring lifestyle. I just remembered a time when I was explaing to a friend what I like todo, staying at home. As boring as it sounds, she share her love for travelling with me, and asked me if I want to travel later in life, just for me to say "NO". Besides the walks I enjoy with my mom in the neighbourhood, those are the most exciting travels I can only think of. I remember the first time I ever tried scrambled eggs was in a plane from Kigali to Atlanta for a new semester in college, took a bite and probably didn't even swallow, then spent the rest of the 16 hour flight with literaly just water. So travelling? Moving from place to place, No thanks. What makes a life interesting? Isn't it one's Peace and joy in the faith and love they share and receive. 
Who is really worth defining fun for one's life? Who is worth defining joy, success, and wealth for yourself if not the one and only who created you? He knows you, and woudn't love to see the messed up views and other's philosophies take over his will and nature's ways of nourishing yours.
