15 Feb,

So, what keeps me up late at night? I can say the beautiful memories of my family and loud laughter waking everyone up for breakfast. Or the idea of what's next that trigger my nervous system to thoughts of what would happen if I quit it all, and just chose a much more easier life with less workloads. Or can I say the joy in knowing my lived experiences have gathered data enough to convince me, I need to stop overthinking, and sleep right now, or the whole week's schedule is all messed up.
