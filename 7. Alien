18 Feb,

What's life outside spiritual world? Don't we all really have where we belong? Who says so? You can ask too. I do everyday and I get all kinds of different evidence, 
that the one above all is transcendent, just that. Gracious, and 24/7 drop in office hours. Seriously, in the daily self-talk, and beliefs that lived moments deforms in a good way
or otherwise I would feel like an alien in this borrowed body. Well, I try not to, and I think I did a great job today.

By the way, I have never felt happy buying a cookie. I was walking to get dinner, halfway through my 10 hour live video stream, a 7ish year old girl approached me and asked me to buy a cookie,
her family was selling them at the Asbury Circle, amazed as I watched her talk to other students and gathering them to her parents for sells. What a beautiful day:)
