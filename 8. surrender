The self image, the one you see when you think of self anywhere; walking, sleeping, laughing, speaking, eating,the sense of self beyond conditionings functions. A character that never runs out of locutions, but is overwhelmed when 
new emotions are called out but aren't declared yet, so now they are embarrasing or wierd. A character that is more interesting when surrendered to, and given space to be seen, expressed, and loud. That is self!
