The days I cared less and the days I couldn't help but care, they are all within the same circumference of the day I saw today. Isn't it cool and almost beautiful that today I could see yesterday; a full picture
of it. So that tomorrow I can care less for I know in the fullness of time, is a hindsight in which I behold the portrait of all that can make sense. 
Make it make sense!
