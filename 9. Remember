28 Feb

The days I cared less and the days I couldn't help but care, they are all in the same circumference of the day I had to see today. Isn't it cool but only beautiful that I can see a full picture
of why I was happy and why things went the way they did. So that tomorrow I can care less for I know the moment is somewhere in the future when the moods and swings can all make sense. Now make it make sense!
